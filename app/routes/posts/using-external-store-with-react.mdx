# Using external store with React

> Disclaimer: If you already know what the built-in hook `useSyncExternalStore` do and what problem it solved, You should probably pass this blog.

[idea: use use-sync-external-store]
Summary: Whether you are maintaining an React library which implement an 'external store'
or writing one that is only used in your own projects, you should use the
official `use-sync-external-store` shim package.

[idea: when external store is needed]
Most of the time, as a product developer, I don't need to write my `external store` to store data. I just store them in `useState` and `useReducer` hooks and pass data
around through props or context. But there are libraries heavily used in our project that internally store data outside of React, for example, tanstack-query and zustand.
Those libraries often internally separate their core logic from the UI render layer(React, Preact, Svelte, etc) into a different module and combine them with a so-called 'adaptor'.

[rewrite]
I'm mainly a product devloper and I only have a few 'global state' in my project, so, most of the time I don't need to write my state management solution. when I do need global
state I will choose `zustand` or, if the change of the state is not frequent, I just put them in `useState` and `useReducer` hooks in the root component and pass them down using React Context.
But there are libraries used in our project that internally store data outside of React(aka an 'external store'), for example, [react-query](https://tanstack.com/query/v4) and [zustand](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand).
Both libraries separate their core logic from React code into a different module and combine them with a 'adaptor', which makes those libraries framework agnostic possible.
All the interesting thing I gonna talk about happened in the 'adaptor'.

[idea: what does an adaptor do]
The purpose of using an 'adaptor' is to make UI render aware of the existence of the `external store` and react to its data change. Pre to React 18, There is a prevalence pattern
being used to implement the 'adaptor'. I simplify it as follows:

[rewrite]
Basiclly, adaptor informs React about the updates of data and give the newest value to render. Pre to React 18, there was a prevalence pattern used to implement the adaptor, I simplify it as follow:

```javascript
import { useRef, useReducer, useLayoutEffect, useEffect } from "react";
import createStore from "external-store";

// The store has some properties:
// {
//   subscribe,
//   getState,
//   setState,
// }

function useStore({ store, selector }) {
  const [, forceRender] = useReducer(() => {}, {});
  const stateRef = useRef();

  if (storeRef.current === undefined) {
    stateRef.current = selector(store.getState());
  }

  useEffect(() => {
    const handleUpdate = () => {
      const newState = selector(this.storeRef.current.getState());
      if (Object.is(newState, stateRef.current)) {
        stateRef.current = newState;
        forceRender();
      }
    };

    const unsubscribe = store.subscribe(handleUpdate);

    return () => unsubscribe();
  }, [selector, store]);

  return stateRef.current;
}
```

Here is what happened in the hook:

- Pass the `store` to the hooks, it'll give the `stateRef` a value for the first render using `getState` method.
- Set up a subscription in `effect`, every time `handleUpdate` is called, it will get the newest selected state by calling `getState` and `selector` functions again and
  comparing it with the old state, if it's not equal to previously stored value, it updates `stateRef.current` and forces React to re-render.
- The `effect` will be cleared and re-run if the store or selector changed.
- The hook returns the value of `stateRef.current` as result.
