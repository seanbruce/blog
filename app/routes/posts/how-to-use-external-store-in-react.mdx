# Using external store with React

> Disclaimer: If you already know what the built-in hook `useSyncExternalStore` do and what problem it solved, You should probably pass this blog.

[idea: use use-sync-external-store]
Summary: Whether you are maintaining an React library which implement an 'external store'
or writing one that is only used in your own projects, you should use the
official `use-sync-external-store` shim package.

[idea: what is external store]
First, it has to be clear what is an 'external state' before we talk about 'external store'. An 'external state' is a state that is not managed by React.
Generally speaking, if you store data neither in `useState` nor `useReducer` hooks in your React component, it is an 'external state'. An 'external store'
is just an 'external state' with some extra logic attach to it.

[idea: when external store is needed]
Most of the time, as a product developer, I don't need to write my `external store` to store data. I just store them in `useState` and `useReducer` hooks and pass data
around through props or context. But there are libraries heavily used in our project that internally store data outside of React, for example, tanstack-query and zustand.
Those libraries often internally separate their core logic from the UI render layer(React, Preact, Svelte, etc) into a different module and combine them with a so-called 'adaptor'.

[rewrite]
I'm mainly a product devloper and I store my data using `useState` or `useReducer` most of the time. However, there are libraries used in my project that internally store data outside of React,
for example, [react-query](https://tanstack.com/query/v4) and [zustand](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand). Both libraries separate their core logic from React code into a different module and talk to each other with a 'adaptor'.
All the interesting thing I gonna talk about happened in the 'adaptor'.

[idea: what does an adaptor do]
The purpose of using an 'adaptor' is to make UI render aware of the existence of the `external store` and react to its data change. Pre to React 18, There is a prevalence pattern
being used to implement the 'adaptor'. I simplify it as follows:

[rewrite]
The 'adaptor' is a module that implements the logic to connect the 'external store' with the UI render layer. In the context of React, there is a pervasive pattern used to implement the 'adaptor'.
I simplify it as follows:

```javascript
import { useRef, useReducer, useLayoutEffect, useEffect } from "react";
import createStore from "external-store";

// The store has some properties:
// {
//   subscribe,
//   getState,
//   setState,
// }

function useStore({ store, selector }) {
  const [, forceRender] = useReducer(() => {}, {});
  const stateRef = useRef();

  if (storeRef.current === undefined) {
    stateRef.current = selector(store.getState());
  }

  useEffect(() => {
    const handleUpdate = () => {
      const newState = selector(this.storeRef.current.getState());
      if (Object.is(newState, stateRef.current)) {
        stateRef.current = newState;
        forceRender();
      }
    };

    const unsubscribe = store.subscribe(handleUpdate);

    return () => unsubscribe();
  }, [selector, store]);

  return stateRef.current;
}
```

> Don't copy this code. use `use-sync-external-store` shim.

- 'external store' have to be able to be subscribed to by the 'adaptor'.
- 'adaptor' could subscribe to whole or part of the stored data.
- if the data changed, the 'adaptor' should trigger a re-render.

It's quite easy to follow the code above once the pattern is recognized,
but a few details need to be taken into account. Well, to name a few,
'what if data in store changed after rendering but before subscribtion?', 'what will happended if the rendering is asyncrhonous?' or 'what else should be considered if doing SSR'?

I strongly suggest you to read the [official useSyncExternalStore documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#usesyncexternalstore)
and [source code](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/2c7dea73659da283fa433f5fd657a5a29797fd67/packages/use-sync-external-store/src/useSyncExternalStoreShim.js) of the shim package.
It's basically implemented the pattern described above with all the 'gocha' solved for pre React 18 version, and switch to built-in `useSyncExternalStore` hook otherwise.
