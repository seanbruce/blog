# Using external store with React

> Disclaimer: As a hint, if you already know what the built-in hook `useSyncExternalStore` does and what problem it can solve, You should probably pass this blog.

Summary: Whether you are maintaining an React library which implement an 'external store'
or writing one that is only used in your own projects, you should use the
official `use-sync-external-store` shim package.

First, it has to be clear what is an 'external state' before we talk about 'external store'. An 'external state' is a state that is not managed by React.
Generally speaking, if you store data neither in `useState` nor `useReducer` hooks in your React component, it is an 'external state'. An 'external store'
is just an 'external state' with some extra logic attached to it.

I'm mainly a product devloper and I store my data using `useState` or `useReducer` most of the time. However, there are libraries used in my project that internally store data outside of React,
for example, [react-query](https://tanstack.com/query/v4) and [zustand](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand). Both libraries separate their core logic from React code into a different module and talk to each other with an 'adaptor'.
And all the interesting thing I gonna talk about happened in the 'adaptor'.

The 'adaptor' is a module that implements the logic to connect the 'external store' with the UI render layer. In the context of React, in many popular library, there is a pervasive pattern used to implement the 'adaptor'.
Here's the code of the pattern, I simplify it a lot:

```javascript
import { useRef, useReducer, useEffect } from "react";
import createStore from "some-external-store";

// The store has some properties:
// {
//   subscribe,
//   getState,
//   setState,
// }

function useStore({ store, selector }) {
  const [, forceRender] = useReducer(() => {}, {});
  const stateRef = useRef();

  if (storeRef.current === undefined) {
    stateRef.current = selector(store.getState());
  }

  useEffect(() => {
    const handleUpdate = () => {
      const newState = selector(this.storeRef.current.getState());
      if (Object.is(newState, stateRef.current)) {
        stateRef.current = newState;
        forceRender();
      }
    };

    const unsubscribe = store.subscribe(handleUpdate);

    return () => unsubscribe();
  }, [selector, store]);

  return stateRef.current;
}
```

> Don't copy this code. use `use-sync-external-store` shim.

I was excited the first time I saw this pattern when reading source code of [react-query](https://tanstack.com/query/v4) and [zustand](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand). I thought that I just found a smart way of doing
performance optimization. It couldn't be more wrong. I didn't realize that until later I wrote my own 'external store'.

This is what happended in 'adaptor':

- 'External store' has to be able to be subscribed to by the 'adaptor'.
- 'Adaptor' could subscribe to whole or part of the stored data.
- In `handleUpdate` callback, if the data change is detected, It should trigger a re-render.

It's quite easy to follow the code above once the pattern is recognized,
but a few details need to be taken into account. To name a few,
'what if data in store changed after rendering but before subscribtion?', 'what will happended if the rendering is asyncrhonous?' or 'what else should be considered if doing SSR'?

If you want to dive deeper, I strongly suggest you to read the [official useSyncExternalStore documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#usesyncexternalstore)
and [source code](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/2c7dea73659da283fa433f5fd657a5a29797fd67/packages/use-sync-external-store/src/useSyncExternalStoreShim.js) of the shim package.
It's basically implemented the pattern described above with all the 'gocha' solved for pre React 18 version, and switch to built-in `useSyncExternalStore` hook otherwise.

That'all, I hope you find this blog useful.
